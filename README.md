# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description
This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.
For HTML, the head element contains information about the webpage and the body element represents the visible content shown to the user.
CSS, A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element, and padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.
Git, git status: checks what branch we are currently on, also git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it.
JavaScript variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code. Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script

- My motivation was to learn HTML, CCS, Git and JavaScript.
- I built this project for the preliminary skills and information need to begin the course.
- I learned how to navigate GitHub, GetBash, create branches, pull reqeust and use the Console tab on the Prework study guide browser.
